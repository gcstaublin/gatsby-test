The Light Environment is our default environment and suitable for most Hudl interfaces. Light Environment characteristics are intended to be smart, reliable and understated.</p>
The Dark Environment is a secondary environment and suitable for focused, immersive content experiences.

<strong>Light Environment</strong> (LE) â€” browsing experiences for everyday work [such as: viewing, managing information]

<strong>Dark Environment</strong> (DE)  immersive content experiences [such as: video editing, tagging]

Only one environment should be used per interface. If you are unsure which environment is right, use Light.
